- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'am still new to JavaScript and currently learning it on udemy, This calculator app required me to make a theme toggler which was quite easy but the main struggle for me was to make the calculator itself i still haven't figured it out but for the time being i have used the ```js eval() ``` function, I will update the app once i figure out how to make the calculator without the help of ```js eval() ``` function.

### Continued development
I will update the app once i figure out how to make the calculator without the help of ```js eval() ``` function.
